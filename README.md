# Foster City Girls Who Code
Girls Who Code FC is a group of 30 young women taking on the world every day (or rather, every Monday from 6:30-8:30). From Foster City to Burlingame, this talented group of middle and high school students meets every week, learning about computer science from two wonderful advisors. These students don't just sit at computers, though. They're out there in the real world, too, organizing community events and hackathons, all while struggling with their regular teenage lives. We dare you, name a more determined group. It's ok, we'll take a number and wait.
